## HackTable2021

This project is the submission for hackathon HackTable 2021.

Mental health refers to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being. It is all about how people think, feel, and behave.

We have created a mental health website which helps you to take care of your mental health more efficiently.

One of the major reasons why mental illness remains untreated is the struggle to open up about it. We have tried to address this problem by creating the “rooms” feature. Using this feature, people can connect with people just like them to share their thoughts and address common challenges while feeling acknowledged and not being judged. We have also included chat to this feature so that people can chat or comment about the ongoing conversation.
We have also incorporated chatbot to help answer common queries regarding mental health and help them getting on-board on our website. 

We believe that our website can make a real difference by making people interact to other people who are going through the same challenges and need a platform to open up about it.  Not everyone is a therapist or counsellor but the people who we interact with shape our emotions and behaviour. Getting them involved can play a major role to the path of recovery.

Our simple solution costs almost nothing. It is simple to use and anyone who wants to take care of their mental health- from children to elderly people can benefit from our website.
